Indexes usually are created based on the columns, but the Expression Indexes(also called Function-based Indexes) let you create an index based on a generic expression(function or modification of data entered) involving the table columns.

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name( (expression) );
```

The parenthesis around the expression can be omitted in cases where the expression involves a function.
When the index is defined, it is used when the expression that defines the index is included in the `WHERE` or `ORDER BY` clause in the YSQL statement.

## Example

A common use case of an expression index is to support case-insensitive text to enable efficient searchability.

For example, let's say there's a `users` table with an `email` column to store their email addresses for signing in, but the user want's to maintain authentication in a case-insensitive manner. This can be done using the `WHERE` clause as WHERE LOWER(email) = '<lower_case_email>', but storing the email address as originally entered by the user.

The following example uses the `employees` table from [Create indexes](../../indexes-constraints/overview/#create-indexes) to show how to create an index on an expression that converts the department to lowercase to improve searchability.

- Verify the query plan without creating an expression index for the department `Operations`.

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees
  WHERE LOWER(department) = 'operations';
```

```output
                         QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on employees  (cost=0.00..105.00 rows=1000 width=68)
   Filter: (lower(department) = 'operations'::text)
(2 rows)
```

- Create an expression index using the following command:

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_employees_department_lc
  ON employees(LOWER(department));
```

- Run the `EXPLAIN` statement again to verify that the `index_employees_department_lc` index is used to find the department regardless of it's case:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees
  WHERE LOWER(department) = 'operations';
```

```output
                          QUERY PLAN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Index Scan using index_employees_department_lc on employees  (cost=0.00..5.25 rows=10 width=68)
  Index Cond: (lower(department) = 'operations'::text)
```

You can also get started with the free tier of [YugabyteDB Fully-Managed Cloud](https://www.yugabyte.com/cloud/). You also need to install the Arctype client on your computer. You can download clients are available for Windows, Linux, and Mac from the [Arctype](https://arctype.com/) website.

If you're using YugabyteDB Cloud, you need to add your computer to the cluster IP allow list. Refer to [Assign IP Allow Lists](../../yugabyte-cloud/cloud-secure-clusters/add-connections/). You also need to download and install CA Cert root.crt certificate on your computer from YugabyteDB Cloud console for TLS encryption.
